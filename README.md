# Housing Price Prediction with a Simple 6-Dense Layers Neural Network

Welcome to the "Housing Price Prediction" repository! In this project, we've built a neural network to predict housing prices based on various features. This repository contains the code and resources used for training and evaluating the model.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project contains information about housing features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The goal is to predict housing prices using this dataset.

## Model Architecture

We've developed a simple neural network with six dense layers for this project. The architecture of the model is as follows:

- Input Layer
- Dense Layer 1
- Dense Layer 2
- Dense Layer 3
- Dense Layer 4
- Dense Layer 5
- Output Layer

## Getting Started

To use and explore the code and model for housing price prediction, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**: You will need Python and the following libraries installed:
   - NumPy
   - Pandas
